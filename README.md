# Test Case Builder

When I worked as a QA Tester I missed coding, so I developed a web app with Vue.js 2 to design, create and automate my documentation tasks.

This saved more than half of the time I spent documenting each new feature of the system.

Live [demo](https://sanchezpepe.github.io/TestCaseBuilder/) hosted with Github pages

That's all.

## GUI
This is how it looks (in case the library gets deprecated and the url no longer works hehe)
