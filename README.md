# Test Case Builder

When I worked as a QA Tester I missed coding, so I developed a web app with Vue.js 2 to design, create and automate my documentation taks test cases in a single GUI

This saved more than half of the time I spent docummenting each new feature of the system.

That's all.

## GUI
This is how it looks (in case the library gets deprecated and the url no longer works hehe)
